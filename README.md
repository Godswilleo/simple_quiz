#A SIMPLE QUIZ SYSTEM

## Introduction
The script is for a very simple quiz system which I used to look at the integration of classes
in python.

The system comprise of main.py and question.py

*  Main.py contains the mains script 
*  question.py contains the declared class.

##  How the programme works
The programme prints the questions of the quiz one at a time and appending the next question
as the user progresses. It prompts the user to enter the correct answer when each of the questions
is displayed.

## Dependencies
The dependecies of the programme are same as the one that comes with pycharm by default

## Running the Programme
To start running the programme, install pycharm or any other python interpreter in your system

with main.py opened click the play button in the pycharm environment
